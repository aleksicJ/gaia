# Period analysis of cepheids from GAIA

In this project time-series analysis of anomalous cepheids from GAIA is performed. It can be roughly considered as three subtasks:
1) Querying Results 
2) Period AnaLysis 
3) Joint Analysis

In the first part, GAIA database is queried for objects. Then, for each object, lightcurve is downloaded, and period is calculated. Finally, values for periods obtained from GAIA database and those calculated here can be compared.
